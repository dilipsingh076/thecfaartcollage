The department imparts theoretical aspects of various visual and public arts. The syllabus covers the general history of world art, India and Western Art History from prehistoric to contemporary times and that of far eastern art as well. Historiography or history makes one aware of the relation between aesthetics and politics. Both critical and analytical approaches to art are applicable leading to creative writing and aesthetic thinking. Visual aids like print, photographs, slides and video (CDs, DVDs), films and cassettes about artworks, art movements, artists and museum studies are used to kindle the interest in students towards a better understanding and experience of art. The department conducts regular study tours covering historical monuments, folk traditions, art galleries and museums. Students are also assigned project work for internal submission. Various well known visiting scholars and artists are invited for constant interaction through dialogues and slide lectures.',
